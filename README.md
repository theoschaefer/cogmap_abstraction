## Computational Modeling
Here, we provide information for how to fit the category learning models and how to compute the proximity values in the feature inference task using these models.

### Setup

We fit the two models as Bayesian models in the R statistics environment using the cmdstanr package. We compared them using the LOO method implemented in the loo R package.

Two of the used packages cannot be installed from CRAN:

- First, install cmdstanr using these instructions: https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html
- Second, pull the following github repo: https://github.com/MirkoTh/rutils and install the package from source or use the devtool package and install rtools as follows: devtools::install("your-selected-path\\rutils")

Download the files called "infpro_task-cat_beh" and "infpro_task-cat2_beh", which are going to be provided by the first author via the open science framework (OSF) only after acceptance of the associated manuscript at the respective journal. Create a folder called "data" on the root level of the project (i.e., /hierarchical-categorization/data) and copy the downloaded files to that folder.

### Fitting the Categorization Models

Run the file R/scripts/fit-all-participants-infpro.R

There is a flag called is_saved, which can be set to TRUE or FALSE. If set to FALSE, the models are fitted and the results are saved. When re-running the script on the same machine, you can set is_saved = TRUE, and the saved results are used.

The two prototype models are first compared with each other using LOO model weigths. Then, the winning prototype model is compared against the GCM model, again using LOO model weights.
